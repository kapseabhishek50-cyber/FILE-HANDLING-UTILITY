WRITING FILE CONTENT:
THE WRITEFILE METHOD USES FILES.WRITESTRING() TO CREATE A NEW FILE OR OVERWRITE AN EXISTING ONE. THIS METHOD IS THE MOST DIRECT WAY TO SEND TEXT TO THE DISK IN MODERN JAVA.
READING FILE CONTENT:
THE READFILE METHOD USES FILES.READALLLINES(), WHICH LOADS EVERY LINE OF THE TEXT FILE INTO A LIST. THIS ALLOWS FOR EASY DATA MANIPULATION AND PRINTING TO THE CONSOLE.
MODIFYING FILE CONTENT:
SINCE FILES CANNOT BE EDITED DIRECTLY IN-PLACE, THE MODIFYFILE METHOD FOLLOWS THE "READ-PROCESS-WRITE" WORKFLOW
